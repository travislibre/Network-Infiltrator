•	Assisted with Internal Training Network scoping and research. (May 23rd – May 24th)
o	Drafted an initial report along with Cesar, Jackie, and Xander, as well as helped Cesar and Jackie on computer networking.
o	Got feedback from Marc Skogland on the tool and observed a meeting he hosted along with the other interns and Kevin Calvin.
o	Struggled with project definition and goal setting.
o	Introduced Cesar and Jackie to the 5- & 7-layer models of computer networks, common protocols, router/switch/server functionality, and network essentials.
•	Wrote an Active Directory Cyber Threat Assessment document. (May 24th – June 1st)
o	Task first assigned by Hunter, as our introductory ACyD assignment.
o	Xander and I conducted research into Microsoft Active Directory and related services.
o	Compiled our research into a 14-page formal draft, detailing its function, vulnerabilities, and methods of exploitation.
o	Set up a Virtual Machine network with a Kali Linux, Metasploitable, and Windows Server machine.
	Connected via a virtual switch, with functional virtual cross-channel communication.
o	Established a mock Active Directory to research pen-testing and network reconnaissance, with a built in Domain Services tool and mock users and database.
	Alongside the Virtual Machine network, this will serve as a makeshift lab for experimenting with relevant cyber-offensive tools and techniques.
o	Set up a virtual environment on my research laptop for PowerShell experimentation.
o	Researched file encryption and decryption.
o	Experimented with reverse engineering and solved a crackme box.
***	Learned PowerShell & C# scripting for my intern project. (June 5th – 6th) ***
o	Familiarized myself with best practices, common methods, and network and socket programming.
•	Set up a second virtual Windows Server (June 6th-June 7th)
o	Elaborated on virtual network to better emulate a target system.
•	Completed a majority of the initial project requirements intended to last for the next few sprints. (June 6th – June 8th)
o	Wrote Windows Server and Active Directory enumeration tools to survey a network system.
o	Collected command outputs into a PowerShell data structure.
o	Wrote functions to encode and decode the output for ease of transit.
o	Created an automated script to set up hidden TCP ports and data streams between two virtual end-users and send the encoded data from a compromised system to a listener on another system.
o	Helped provide the core of a scripting framework for future ACyD activities in networked environments.
o	Accomplished all the above without the use of external libraries or dependencies, in order to reduce the visibility of unusual activity.
o	Implemented file compression. 
o	Used Chimera to disguise PowerShell script.
o	Improved documentation.
o	Corrected code to better use the C# .Net framework.
o	Broke code into functions to improve reusability.
o	Expanded TCP network stream functionality by allowing users to define receiver and sender IP addresses.
o	Familiarized myself further with Ghidra, disassembled native Windows and Linux OS files.
o	Learned the full assembly & linking process for compiled code.
o	Started the process of learning Rust, set up a test environment on both machines.
o	Added a volatile memory amsi.dll patch in to bypass the Anti-Malware Scan Interface (AMSI) and prevent script detection.
o	Restructured the entire script to execute entirely on volatile memory, which further enhances its evasiveness.
o	Implemented data segmentation to reduce packet size and reduce network trace.
o	Created a time delay for when packets transmit across the network to stagger network traces.
•	Further improved my research environment by setting up an external switch for my offnet research laptop to allow my Linux VM to access the internet. (6/19)
